# CAPSTONE-PROJECT-SPACE-X

## Project Overview
This repository contains my capstone project for:
- The **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** (Final Course)
- The **Applied Data Science with Python Specialization**

In this real-world simulation, I assumed the role of a Data Scientist at a startup competing with SpaceX, following the complete Data Science lifecycle from data collection to model deployment.

## Project Objectives
- âœ… Predict SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landing success
- ðŸš€ Develop competitive bidding insights for rocket launches
- ðŸ“Š Showcase end-to-end Data Science skills:
  - Data collection & wrangling
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Data visualization
  - Machine learning modeling
  - Model evaluation & optimization
  - Stakeholder reporting

## Key Features
- **Real-world scenario**: Mimics actual Data Science work at a space tech company
- **Comprehensive methodology**: Covers all stages of the Data Science process
- **Practical application**: Results directly applicable to launch cost predictions
- **Portfolio-ready**: Demonstrates competency in:
  - Python data science stack (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
  - Statistical analysis
  - Machine learning (classification)
  - Data storytelling

## Learning Context
This capstone serves as the culmination of my IBM/Python Specialization journey, focusing on **applying** previously learned concepts rather than introducing new material. The project demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with complex, real-world datasets
- Make data-driven decisions
- Communicate technical results effectively

## Business Impact
The predictive models and insights developed here enable:
- More accurate cost projections for rocket launches
- Competitive bid strategies against SpaceX
- Risk assessment for first-stage reusability
